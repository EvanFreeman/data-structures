# Data structures in Javascript

* Singly linked list

## Purpose

Javascript has a lot of libraries that implement all the data structures
that are/will be implemented here. But I felt like doing them myself so that I
can re-familiarize myself with many concepts that I take for granted.

I plan on adding many more structures, and using them to implement a few
algorithms that I have need of in other projects.
